# kurslarim
This project demonstrates foundational concepts of React through a simple application that displays a list of courses. It helped me understand and apply the following key features of React:
Component-based Architecture: The application is structured using reusable functional components.
Props Handling: Data is passed between components using props, ensuring a clean and modular approach to UI design.
State Management: While props are used for passing data, the project also focuses on handling component state to manage dynamic changes in the UI.
Array Mapping: The map() function is used to dynamically render multiple course items.
Prop Validation: PropTypes are used to ensure proper data types are passed to components, helping with debugging and development best practices.
This project served as a hands-on introduction to React's core principles, enabling me to solidify my understanding of component-driven development.
